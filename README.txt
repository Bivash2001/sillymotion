üé¨ Creator‚Äôs Statement ‚Äî Why I Made SillyMotion
=======================================================

Ever since I was a kid, I‚Äôve loved stop motion ‚Äî especially Aardman‚Äôs classics like Wallace & Gromit and Shaun the Sheep. Their style, charm, and humor inspired me to try it myself. But when I wanted to make my own stop motion animations, I hit a wall: every decent program cost money.

Aardman‚Äôs own ‚ÄúAnimate It!‚Äù looked perfect ‚Äî simple, fun, and made for beginners. But the full version cost ¬£19.95 (and now, with inflation, that‚Äôs around ¬£42 today ‚Äî over 50 U.S. dollars). That‚Äôs crazy! You could buy an entire console game for that price!

I just wanted to make silly little clay animations, not a Steven Spielberg movie! But instead of being accessible, most stop motion software was either too expensive or too complicated. And that‚Äôs a huge problem ‚Äî because animation should be a fun hobby, not a luxury.

So, I made my own tool:
SillyMotion.

It‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs browser-based.
No installs. No paywalls. No subscriptions.
Just pure animation fun for anyone ‚Äî kids, hobbyists, or pros who miss the charm of DIY creativity.

I built this program to prove that animation can be fun, accessible, and open-source all at once.
I wanted to bring back that old spirit of tinkering ‚Äî when people made art with what they had, and studios like Aardman were working out of a garage.

I‚Äôm proud to say this project balances accessibility and functionality ‚Äî something the animation world desperately needs again.

If big companies want to treat creativity like a luxury, then fine ‚Äî we‚Äôll make our own tools.
SillyMotion is for the dreamers, the hobbyists, and the silly animators who just want to make things move and laugh.

Let‚Äôs make cartoons silly again. üí´
