   REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).
- A webcam (for capturing frames).
- Optional: an audio file (MP3, WAV, OGG) for syncing animation.

-----------------------------------------
   LIMITATIONS
-----------------------------------------
- Exported WebM videos are **silent** (audio does not embed).
- Project saves store the *filename* of the audio, not the file itself. 
  (You‚Äôll need to keep your audio file handy and reload it when continuing a project.)
- No GIF export (due to browser limitations).
- Works best with short to medium-length animations ‚Äî very large projects may slow down your browser.
