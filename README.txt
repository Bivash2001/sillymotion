        Marz's SillyMotion v1.1
=========================================

Stop-motion made silly and simple! 🎉  
This is a free browser-based stop motion animation tool created for cartoon lovers, hobbyists, and anyone who wants to make frame-by-frame animations without complicated software or expensive subscriptions.

-----------------------------------------
   WHAT'S NEW IN v1.1
-----------------------------------------
- 🖱️ **Draggable Frames** – Reorder your frames directly in the timeline by dragging and dropping.  
- 👻 **Onion Skinning (Multi-Layer)** – Overlay previous and/or next frames on top of your live camera feed to help align movement more precisely.  
- ⚡ General improvements and fixes to keep animations smooth and easy.  

-----------------------------------------
   FEATURES
-----------------------------------------
- Capture frames directly from your webcam.
- Visual playback side-by-side with your live camera feed.
- Timeline UI to view, duplicate, delete, or reorder frames.
- Onion Skin toggle (previous, next, or both).
- Add an audio track for animating in sync with sound.
- Adjustable FPS (frames per second) with a live number indicator.
- Save & load projects in .json format (keeps frames, FPS, and audio filename).
- Export finished animations as silent WebM videos.
- Simple, fun, and cartoon-inspired design.

-----------------------------------------
   HOW TO USE
-----------------------------------------
1. Allow your browser to use your webcam when prompted.
2. Click "Capture Frame" to take snapshots for your animation.
3. Use the Timeline to manage your frames:
   - Click a frame to select it.
   - Duplicate (⧉), Delete (✕), or Drag to reorder frames.
4. Turn Onion Skin on/off in the controls:
   - Choose to overlay the previous frame, next frame, or both.
5. Adjust FPS with the slider to control playback speed.
6. (Optional) Add an audio file to animate in sync with sound.
7. Press "Play" to preview your animation with audio.
8. Press "Stop" to reset playback.
9. Use "Save Project" to store your work as a .json file.
10. Use "Load Project" to continue working later.
11. Export your animation as a WebM video when finished!

-----------------------------------------
   REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).
- A webcam (for capturing frames).
- Optional: an audio file (MP3, WAV, OGG) for syncing animation.

-----------------------------------------
   LIMITATIONS
-----------------------------------------
- Exported WebM videos are **silent** (audio does not embed).
- Project saves store the *filename* of the audio, not the file itself. 
  (You’ll need to keep your audio file handy and reload it when continuing a project.)
- No GIF export (due to browser limitations).
- Works best with short to medium-length animations — very large projects may slow down your browser.
